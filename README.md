# 👋 Hi, I'm Changdae Kwak
--------------------------------------
## 🎯 Embedded Electronics & FPGA Developer
- Working on motor control systems using Zynq SoC, with experience in FPGA-based control logic, 
encoder signal filtering, and PCB design for EMC compliance. I focus on real-time embedded processing and hardware-software co-design.

## What I Do
- Verilog-based Motor Control
Encoder Filter, Digital Signal Filter, PWM generator, and PI/PID/Fuzzy control logic implemented in PL (FPGA)

- Zynq SoC Embedded Development
AXI4-Lite interface between PS and PL using Vivado and Vitis, with UART-based command input and real-time response generation

- Motor Driver PCB Design
Designed motor control boards with proper EMC considerations (TVS, choke, ground routing)

## 🛠 Field Experience
### Former field engineer in surgical robotics
- Involved in system maintenance, motor tuning, and hardware debugging for minimally invasive surgical systems

## 📁 Featured Repositories
- verilog_motor_controller: Verilog modules for motor control, encoder processing, and AXI interface
- embedded_pcb_projects: Custom motor driver PCBs and power circuit designs
